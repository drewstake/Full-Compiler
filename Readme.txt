How to Compile and Run

1. Extract the ZIP File  
Unzip the file and place the extracted folder anywhere you want.  

2. Open a Terminal  
Go to the folder where you extracted the files by using:  

cd /path/to/extracted/project  

Replace /path/to/extracted/project with the actual folder location.  

3. Compile the Java Files  
Run this command to compile all the Java files:  

javac *.java  

This will create the necessary .class files.  

4. Run the Program  
To run the program, use:  

java Program tests/<inputFile>

example: java Program tests/test2.minc

Replace <inputFile> with the actual input file you want to use.
