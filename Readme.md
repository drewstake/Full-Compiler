# Compilation Instructions

1. Open a terminal (or command prompt) and navigate to the project directory (the folder containing all the .java files).

2. Compile the program by running:

       javac *.java

   This command compiles all Java source files and generates the corresponding .class files.

3. (Optional) To run the program, execute:

       java Program <inputFile>

   For example, if you want to run the program on "tests/test8.minc", use:

       java Program tests/test8.minc
